# Functional Programming

As concept I want to show Which continent has the most objects out of different categories and what kind of categorie has the highest or lowest percentage. To do this I want to create an overview that shows every head categories in a radar chart. In this chart I want to make five circular grid types. The chart will make use of interactive styles like filtering on the categories or continents, but also annotating will be used in this chart to give extra information like percentage and difference between the continents.

The whole process of creating this application will all be documented in the [wiki](https://github.com/RooyyDoe/functional-programming/wiki) of my repository.

## API
(API Call with explanation)

This API allows you to get data of different historical events. This can be for example historic objects or pictures from all over the world. We all have obtained an individual endpoint to substract certain data from this database. 

I made use of the following API:
