# Functional Programming

I want to show for all the categories how the objects are distributed over the continents within a certain category. To do this I want to create an overview that shows all the main categories in a radar chart. In this chart I want to make five circular grid types displaying the amount of objects in percentage within a category. The continents will be displayed as different chart layers where each continent has a different color. The chart will make use of interactive styles such as filtering on the different categories or continents, but also annotating will be used in this chart to provide more information about the exact value of the percentage and the difference between the continents.

The whole process of creating this application will all be documented in the [wiki](https://github.com/RooyyDoe/functional-programming/wiki) of my repository.

## Assignment

Create a data visualisation with d3 based on given data.

## Interactions

- [ ] User is going to be able to **hover** over the continents and they will be highlighted when the cursor is hovering on the element.
- [ ] User is going to be able to **filter** the chart by using the legenda.
- [ ] User is going to be able to see **Annotations** when they click on the main categories.
- [ ] User is going to be able to **Compair** two continents with each other by selecting them.

## Installation

**Clone the repository of the project**

### API
(API Call with explanation)

This API allows you to get data of different historical events. This can be for example historic objects or pictures from all over the world. We all have obtained an individual endpoint to substract certain data from this database. 

I made use of the following API:

* [GVN](https://data.netwerkdigitaalerfgoed.nl/)

* [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - Mostly used this site to get my sources from
* [D3](https://d3js.org/) - This source I will mostly use for d3 related problems
* [D3 In Depth](https://www.d3indepth.com/) - This source will go in further in the D3 possibilities
* [Remaining Sources](https://github.com/RooyyDoe/functional-programming/wiki/Remaining-Sources) - My Remaining sources can be found at this page and I will also put in the real sources and not global ones.

## Credits

* [Help from Thijs Spijker](https://github.com/iSirThijs) - Helped me with cleaning my data and explained different high-order functions. Next to this Thijs is still a good guy to talk with about problems u walk into and he will always be ready to help you out.
* [Help from Wessel Smit](https://github.com/WesselSmit) — Wessel helped me with my concept and is also a good guy that you can ask certain programming problems and he will give hes opinion and how he will fix the problem.
* [Help from Stefan Gerrits](https://github.com/StefanGerrits2) — We did a lot of programming together and looked at each others code to fix certain things.
* [Help from Sjors Eveleens](https://github.com/Choerd) - He helped me look at my project in a different way when I was thinking way to difficult. He also gave me an option how I can turn my arrays into objects what helped me a lot.
